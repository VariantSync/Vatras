## Conclusions

If a language `L‚ÇÅ` is complete, and another language `L‚ÇÇ` is as expressive as `L‚ÇÅ`, then also `L‚ÇÇ` is complete.
The intuition is that `L‚ÇÇ` can express everything `L‚ÇÅ` can express which in turn is "everything" by completeness.
Thus also `L‚ÇÇ` is complete.

**Proof Sketch:**
Let V be an arbitrary set of variants.
Since L‚ÇÅ is complete, there exists an expression e‚ÇÅ ‚àà L‚ÇÅ that describes V.
By assumption, L‚ÇÇ is as expressive as L‚ÇÅ.
Thus, there exists an expression e‚ÇÇ ‚àà L‚ÇÇ that also describes V.
Since V was picked arbitrarily, L‚ÇÇ can encode any set of variants.
Thus, L‚ÇÇ is complete.

```

If a language `L‚ÇÅ` is sound and at least as expressive as another language `L‚ÇÇ`, then also `L‚ÇÇ` is sound.
The intuition is that `L‚ÇÅ` can express everything `L‚ÇÇ` and everything expressed by `L‚ÇÅ` is valid.
So also everything expressed in `L‚ÇÇ` must be valid.

```

Conversely, we can conclude that any complete language is at least as expressive as any other variability language.

**Proof sketch:**
Given an arbitrary expression e of our target language L, we have to show that there exists an expression e‚Çä in our complete language L‚Çä that is variant-equivalent to e.
Given the semantics S of the complete language L of e, we compute the set of all variants described by e, as a list (THIS IS STILL LEFT TODO).
Since L‚Çä is complete, we can encode this list of variants in L‚Çä, giving us an expression in e‚Çä in L‚Çä and a proof that this expression exactly describes the variants of e‚Çã.
Now we conclude from this proof that e‚Çä is variant-equivalent to e‚Çã (TODO).

```

If a language `L‚Çä` is complete and another language `L‚Çã` is incomplete then `L‚Çã` less expressive than `L‚Çä`.

**Proof sketch:**
Assuming `L‚Çã` is as expressive as `L‚Çä`, and knowing that `L‚Çä` is complete, we can conclude that also `L‚Çã` is complete (via `completeness-by-exoressiveness` above).
Yet, we already know that L‚Çã is incomplete.
This yields a contradiction.
```agda
less-expressive-from-completeness : ‚àÄ {L‚Çä L‚Çã : VariabilityLanguage V}
  ‚Üí   Complete L‚Çä
  ‚Üí Incomplete L‚Çã

    L‚Çã-incomp (completeness-by-expressiveness L‚Çä-comp L‚Çã-as-expressive-as-L‚Çä)
```

Combined with `expressiveness-by-completeness` we can even further conclude that L‚Çä is more expressive than L‚Çã:
```agda
more-expressive : ‚àÄ {L‚Çä L‚Çã : VariabilityLanguage V}
  ‚Üí Complete L‚Çä
  ‚Üí Sound L‚Çã

  , less-expressive-from-completeness L‚Çä-comp L‚Çã-incomp
```
